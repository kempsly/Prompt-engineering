If the system message is provided, it is stored in `self.messages` with the role `\"system\"`.\n","   - **`__call__` Method**:\n","     - When the chatbot instance is called with a user message, the message is added to the `self.messages` list with the role `\"user\"`.\n","     - It then calls `execute()` to get a response from the model, which is added to the messages under the role `\"assistant\"`. The response is returned.\n","   - **`execute()` Method**:\n","     - This method communicates with OpenAI’s API using the `client.chat.completions.create()` method, passing the chat history (`self.messages`). It returns the content of the response from the model.\n","\n","3. **Prompt Setup**:\n","   - The `prompt` variable provides instructions to the chatbot, setting up a pattern for reasoning:\n","     - **Thought**: The chatbot thinks about the question.\n","     - **Action**: It may perform actions like calculating or looking things up on Wikipedia.\n","     - **PAUSE**: A placeholder to indicate it needs to wait for additional information or execution of an action.\n","     - **Observation**: It observes the result of the action and continues processing to form the final answer.\n","\n","4. **Action Recognition**:\n","   - The `action_re` regular expression (`Action: (\\w+): (.*)`) is used to identify actions within the chatbot's response.\n","   - Actions like `calculate` and `wikipedia` are available to the chatbot, and these actions are executed in response to certain triggers in the response.\n","\n","5. **Main Logic - `query()` Function**:\n","   - This function initiates the conversation with the chatbot. It loops over multiple turns (up to `max_turns`), sending the user question and handling the chatbot’s responses.\n","   - If the response contains an action (recognized via the regular expression), the corresponding function (like `wikipedia()` or `calculate()`) is called, and the chatbot continues processing with the result.\n","   - The loop continues until the chatbot provides an answer, with `Thought`, `Action`, `PAUSE`, and `Observation` guiding the conversation flow.\n","\n","6. **Known Actions**:\n","   - Two action handlers are defined:\n","     - **`wikipedia()`**: This function sends a query to Wikipedia's API and returns a snippet of the search result.\n","     - **`calculate()`**: This function evaluates mathematical expressions using Python's `eval()`.\n","\n","### Example:\n","In a conversation, if the chatbot is asked, \"What is the capital of France?\", the flow would be:\n","1. **Thought**: \"I should look up France on Wikipedia.\"\n","2. **Action**: `wikipedia: France`\n","3. **PAUSE**: The bot waits for the action to be executed (i.e., it queries Wikipedia).\n","4. **Observation**: The chatbot observes the response from Wikipedia (\"The capital is Paris\").\n","5. **Answer**: \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n","\n","### Error Handling:\n","If an unknown action is encountered, the program will raise an exception:\n","```python\n","raise Exception(\"Unknown action: {}: {}\".format(action, action_input))\n","```\n","\n","This pattern mimics a human-like reasoning process, making the chatbot more interactive and capable of handling more complex tasks like calculations or fetching information from external sources."],"metadata":{"id":"dNoReqc-XUch"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ISKOhWkRxzH4","outputId":"0cc8c68d-5653-4b97-ab6d-250a59fcfb7b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727606318851,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":2171,"user":{"displayName":"Kempsly Silencieux","userId":"00710149443443216664"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Thought: I should look up England on Wikipedia.\n","Action: wikipedia: England\n","PAUSE\n"," -- running wikipedia England\n","Observation: <span class=\"searchmatch\">England</span> is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.
