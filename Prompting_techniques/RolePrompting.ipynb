This approach involves assigning a specific role to the LLM, such as a math teacher or an expert in a particular field, before presenting it with a task or question. The technique sometimes employs a two-stage framework: first, constructing task-specific role-play prompts that define the LLM's persona, and second, using these prompts to elicit responses for reasoning queries.\n","\n","By immersing the LLM in a carefully chosen role, role-play prompting aims to activate relevant knowledge and reasoning patterns, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. This method has shown promising results across various reasoning tasks, often outperforming standard zero-shot approaches and serving as an effective implicit trigger for chain-of-thought reasoning. Role-play prompting represents a simple yet powerful way to leverage the LLM's ability to adopt different personas, potentially unlocking improved performance in complex reasoning tasks without the need for few-shot examples or fine-tuning."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"87xIYjAEVK6L"},"source":["### Better Zero-Shot Reasoning with Role-Play Prompting\n","\n","This paper introduces a novel approach called \"role-play prompting\" to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot settings. The method involves a two-stage framework: first, constructing task-specific role-play prompts, and second, using these prompts to elicit responses for reasoning queries. The authors evaluate their approach on 12 diverse reasoning benchmarks using ChatGPT and other open-source LLMs. Results show that role-play prompting consistently outperforms standard zero-shot approaches and often surpasses Zero-Shot-CoT on most datasets.\n","\n","![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n","\n","The study suggests that role-play prompting serves as an effective implicit Chain-of-Thought trigger, leading to improved reasoning outcomes. The authors also explore the impact of prompt design and role selection on performance. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of role-play prompting as a simple yet effective technique for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities and opens up new avenues for research at the intersection of role-playing and reasoning in LLMs.\n","\n","> [Better Zero-Shot Reasoning with Role-Play Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07702) by Zao, S.
