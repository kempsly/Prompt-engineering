This technique leverages the model's existing knowledge and pattern recognition capabilities to understand and emulate the desired behavior or output format.\n","\n","By including relevant examples or demonstrations directly in the prompt (referred to as 'Few-Shot' prompting), users can guide the model to produce more accurate and contextually appropriate responses for specific tasks. ICL allows for quick adaptation to new tasks or domains, making it a powerful and flexible approach in prompt engineering for enhancing model performance across various applications."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_vyVSBfDZ5nD"},"source":["### Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\n","\n","This paper, which introduced GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3), demonstrated the remarkable ability of large language models to perform various tasks with minimal task-specific examples provided in the prompt.\n","The authors showed that GPT-3 could adapt to new tasks simply by presenting it with a few examples in the input prompt, without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, leading to double-digit improvements in accuracy.\n","\n","![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n","\n","This emergent capability, which they termed \"in-context learning,\" marked a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing and prompt engineering. It's worth noting that while this paper brought widespread attention to the concept, it builds upon earlier work in transfer learning and meta-learning. However, the scale and effectiveness demonstrated in the GPT-3 paper made it a landmark study in the field of prompt engineering and large language models.\n","\n","> [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) by Brown, T., et al.
