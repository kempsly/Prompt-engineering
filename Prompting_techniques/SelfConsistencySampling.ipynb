Instead of relying on a single output, self-consistency sampling generates multiple reasoning paths for a given problem. It does this by using temperature sampling or other decoding strategies to produce a variety of potential solutions. The key insight is that while individual reasoning attempts may contain errors, the correct answer is likely to appear consistently across multiple attempts. After generating these diverse paths, the technique aggregates the results, typically by selecting the most frequent answer.\n","\n","This approach leverages the model's ability to approach problems from different angles, potentially overcoming biases or errors present in any single reasoning attempt. Self-consistency sampling is particularly effective for complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical problem-solving or multi-step logical deductions, where it can significantly improve accuracy without requiring any additional training of the underlying model. By embracing variability in the model's outputs, this technique offers a robust way to enhance the reliability and performance of language models in reasoning tasks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Lw0D-IPZdcQs"},"source":["### Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models\n","\n","This paper introduces a novel decoding strategy called \"self-consistency\" to improve chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models. The method works by first prompting the model with chain-of-thought exemplars, then sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths from the model's decoder instead of greedily decoding a single path. Finally, it marginalizes out the reasoning paths to find the most consistent answer among the sampled outputs.\n","\n","![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n","\n","This approach leverages the intuition that complex reasoning tasks often have multiple valid paths to the correct answer, and correct reasoning tends to converge on consistent conclusions. The authors demonstrate that self-consistency significantly improves performance across a range of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, outperforming existing methods like sample-and-rank, beam search, and ensemble approaches. They show substantial gains on benchmarks such as GSM8K (+17.9%), SVAMP (+11.0%), AQuA (+12.2%), StrategyQA (+6.4%), and ARC-challenge (+3.9%). Importantly, self-consistency requires no additional training or fine-tuning and works with off-the-shelf language models, making it a simple yet effective method for enhancing reasoning capabilities
