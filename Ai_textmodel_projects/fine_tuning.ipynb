'assistant', 'content': 'To understand how agencies price their services and think about profitability, is to understand the economics of an agency model. Most people who don’t work or haven’t worked at an agency don’t understand how agencies make money. This guide will bring light to what’s going on under the hood, and how to negotiate the best deal for your company.Employees — this side of the business doesn’t actually make much money for the agency. They might bill clients $200,000 a year, but with salaried employees you must pay even when demand suddenly drops off (like the COVID pandemic!). However employees are the backbone of the agency and keeping the same consultants on your project for a long period of time is how you get consistently good work done.Fixed Costs — such as offices, marketing, legal fees, insurance, training, events, payroll taxes and benefits, add up to about 20% of revenue (general overheads). These costs are pretty fixed and aren’t actually tied to revenue so adding a new client doesn’t incur much more cost (apart from handling their billing and onboarding) variable costs. These costs are almost all non-billable.In honor of the famous 80/20 rule or the Pareto Principle, it’s interesting to note how often these numbers seem to appear in businesses:https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-pareto-principle-91ef62b2b6dbThe number itself comes from the observation that in many companies 20% clients account for 80% of revenue, or that 20% of a company’s products account for 80% of sales. For an agency, the first 20% of rate therefore accounts for 80% of it’s profit margin, meaning they make 80% of their money billing at $400 an hour, but only 20% of their money charging $200 an hour.Variable Costs — make up about 20% of revenue for an agency, and can vary wildly depending on how the agency is set up and other strategic decisions. There can be high variable costs associated with certain services, like media buying or direct paid advertising, but other services may not involve much additional cost whenever you take on new work.In the table below I’ve estimated the profit margins at each price point and how in the main examples you see online the agency is breaking even or taking a loss for the first few months (which motivated them to switch you). Then, once they’ve turned a profit, the model starts to behave exponentially. As we see $400 an hour clients bring let’s say $400,000, the majority of that 80% profit goes straight to profit.https://www.arcstone.com/news-events/why-are-net-profit-margin-levels-of-marketing-agencies-so-highWhen you start bringing in $500 an hour clients, that’s where agencies really start making their money. That 80% profit margin they were doing so well at $400 an hour, suddenly becomes 95% profit margin. This is why agencies tend to raise prices when busy. This guide tells you exactly when to do that (Chapter 10).Another factor that’s not obvious is that services can be delivered by many types of organizations, with radically different cost structures. For example you could outsource your marketing to an overseas freelancer for $10 an hour, as opposed to an agency charging you $400 an hour. Why is the agency so expensive?In many cases, the perceived value (and realized value) is higher because an agency can provide a predictable experience at scale. The risk of failure is lower, the quality is better (on average), and the value you tend to get from an agency is higher (though not always!). The premium paid for the agency (often up to 10X) is for them being able to deliver results with minimal management required from you, with no need to micromanage the campaign, and no need to worry about constant monitoring when priorities shift. It’s a tax you’re paying for peace-of-mind!It’s also worth noting that agencies operate with huge uncertainty and risk to balance. An agency aquire new clients when revenue has dipped and they’re heading downwards, so there’s a risk you’re going to get a consultant that isn’t motivated and isn’t going to stick around long enough to make good on the promises that got you so excited about their company. Similarly the profitability of a fixed-costs laden agency drops dramatically when demand drops off (as happened in the great recession, and again with COVID).https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13602365.2021.1882254Note: only high-performing consultants actually get paid hourly rates and can charge their clients at these rates. The rest of the expenses (more than 60% of the costs of the agency) go to paying for high fixed costs.All these factors add up to how an agency makes money with a not-so-magic number: 10%. As an agency CEO if I make a 10% EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin at the end of the year I can claim to have run a successful business. This is why these two words appear in solicitations and contracts for every major contract over $1 million in the business.The not-so-short version of this story, and the point I want you to remember, is that most agencies go out of business. That’s what makes the story of any successful agency, like a Weiden+Kennedy, Moz, Portent (before they got bought by Clearlink) or early case study ($50,000 in monthly managed services fees for 5 years at Credo) so good. This is why it’s so important to measure return on investment, and why every agency is always so diligent about showing sales funnels and revenue.https://martechtoday.com/digital-agencies-whats-driving-their-growth-273400In conclusion it’s difficult to say exactly how marketing agencies make money, because it really depends on the agency. Don’t take company websites at face value, the marketing materials are all smoke and mirrors. In my experience you needed to know a thing or two about business strategy to dig down into the economics to figure it out.When choosing a marketing strategy the question isn’t so much if an agency can deliver profitable growth. With the right strategy you could turn $5k into $50k in profit far more easily than spending the lifetime of an employee onboarding them in choice company policies, or building up a legal team just to negotiate with small business partners.The real question everyone should ask themselves when they’re considering to take on funding for a growth marketing project — what if we can’t do it ourselves? If we can’t perform the equivalent with a full time hire in 3–6 months, are we even remotely looking at $400k-$500k other big players in our industry could be hemorrhaging as company communications find new ways to make us look bad?Yes, I think the question should isn’t why would you hire a marketing agency, but why would you pay an agency to promote your latest ‘Lactose Free Milk’ launch at all? Nobody’s building a business for agency folk in this market, you didn’t hear it here, your incharge of your code and your customers strategy, so behave with the respect for the game of the Street.

For example, one critique that GKC Chen repeats in several of his works, is that memetics is unfalsifiable as a theory. If the memetic theory can explain any outcome with rational meme selection, then the theory cannot be properly tested as it lacks predictive value.Other objections are conceptual in nature. It's difficult to define what exactly a meme is and what makes two ideas similar. The way memes proliferate can also be highly unpredictable and difficult to model - does the mechanism of going viral follow all the properties that define a meme? I’d argue these criticisms are valid, but not necessarily fatal to memetics as a field.Simulations can be built around off of any unifying theory of culture, like memes, and improve on it in a piecemeal fashion — burning away the parts that seem least useful, and adding new cultural transfer mechanisms. - Mark JamesAuthoritarian critics, in contrast, argue that memes must convince victims by force, of their superiority augmented with fear campaigns to ensure the leader’s survival. In this “toxic” version of meme diffusion, the criticisms really get harsh. This is often the area of memetics associated with coercion – forcing memes into the heads of enemies. - Evolution scholar Michael S. Ferguson, Ph.D.The fact that these models work on the basis of competition and replication, drive marketers’ focus towards these strategies, which simplifies thinking about marketing as a whole.
