In this case, it’s set to 128 kbps (kilobits per second), a common bitrate for MP3 audio.\n","\n","6. **`output.mp3`**: This is the **output file name**. The command will extract the audio from the video file and save it as an `MP3` file with the specified name.\n","\n","### What It Does:\n","- FFmpeg takes the MKV video file, ignores the video stream (`-vn`), and extracts the audio.\n","- The extracted audio is saved as an MP3 file (`output.mp3`), with a bitrate of 128 kbps (`-ab 128k`).\n","\n","### Example Use Case:\n","This command would be useful if you want to **extract the audio** (e.g., a podcast or music) from a video file, converting it to an MP3 format without retaining any video content.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"QMiaG0sw4XVz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# !ffmpeg -i \"SINACH: NO OTHER NAME ｜ OFFICIAL VIDEO [pIfN9-d1ddM].webm\" -vn -ab 128k output_sinach.mp3\n"],"metadata":{"id":"obLzVq6z6_IV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728488368480,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Kempsly Silencieux","userId":"00710149443443216664"}}},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!ffmpeg -i \"/content/SINACH： NO OTHER NAME ｜ OFFICIAL VIDEO [pIfN9-d1ddM].webm\" -vn -ab 128k output_sinach.mp3"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_axOmtcC7rm-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728488368480,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":13465,"user":{"displayName":"Kempsly Silencieux","userId":"00710149443443216664"}},"outputId":"fe0d86c9-ddd2-4741-afde-6063f1ea7eb3"},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["ffmpeg version 4.4.2-0ubuntu0.22.04.1 Copyright (c) 2000-2021 the FFmpeg developers\n","  built with gcc 11 (Ubuntu 11.2.0-19ubuntu1)\n","  configuration: --prefix=/usr --extra-version=0ubuntu0.22.04.1 --toolchain=hardened --libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu --incdir=/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu --arch=amd64 --enable-gpl --disable-stripping --enable-gnutls --enable-ladspa --enable-libaom --enable-libass --enable-libbluray --enable-libbs2b --enable-libcaca --enable-libcdio --enable-libcodec2 --enable-libdav1d --enable-libflite --enable-libfontconfig --enable-libfreetype --enable-libfribidi --enable-libgme --enable-libgsm --enable-libjack --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libmysofa --enable-libopenjpeg --enable-libopenmpt --enable-libopus --enable-libpulse --enable-librabbitmq --enable-librubberband --enable-libshine --enable-libsnappy --enable-libsoxr --enable-libspeex --enable-libsrt --enable-libssh --enable-libtheora --enable-libtwolame --enable-libvidstab --enable-libvorbis --enable-libvpx --enable-libwebp --enable-libx265 --enable-libxml2 --enable-libxvid --enable-libzimg --enable-libzmq --enable-libzvbi --enable-lv2 --enable-omx --enable-openal --enable-opencl --enable-opengl --enable-sdl2 --enable-pocketsphinx --enable-librsvg --enable-libmfx --enable-libdc1394 --enable-libdrm --enable-libiec61883 --enable-chromaprint --enable-frei0r --enable-libx264 --enable-shared\n","  libavutil      56. 70.100 / 56. 70.100\n","  libavcodec     58.134.100 / 58.134.100\n","  libavformat    58. 76.100 / 58. 76.100\n","  libavdevice    58. 13.100 / 58. 13.100\n","  libavfilter     7.110.100 /  7.110.100\n","  libswscale      5.  9.100 /  5.  9.100\n","  libswresample   3.  9.100 /  3.  9.100\n","  libpostproc    55.  9.100 / 55.  9.100\n","Input #0, matroska,webm, from '/content/SINACH： NO OTHER NAME ｜ OFFICIAL VIDEO [pIfN9-d1ddM].webm':\n","  Metadata:\n","    ENCODER         : Lavf58.76.100\n","  Duration: 00:05:55.54, start: -0.007000, bitrate: 1118 kb/s\n","  Stream #0:0(eng): Video: vp9 (Profile 0), yuv420p(tv, bt709), 1280x720, SAR 1:1 DAR 16:9, 24 fps, 24 tbr, 1k tbn, 1k tbc (default)\n","    Metadata:\n","      DURATION        : 00:05:55.499000000\n","  Stream #0:1(eng): Audio: opus, 48000 Hz, stereo, fltp (default)\n","    Metadata:\n","      DURATION        : 00:05:55.541000000\n","Stream mapping:\n","  Stream #0:1 -> #0:0 (opus (native) -> mp3 (libmp3lame))\n","Press [q] to stop, [?] for help\n","Output #0, mp3, to 'output_sinach.mp3':\n","  Metadata:\n","    TSSE            : Lavf58.76.100\n","  Stream #0:0(eng): Audio: mp3, 48000 Hz, stereo, fltp, 128 kb/s (default)\n","    Metadata:\n","      DURATION        : 00:05:55.541000000\n","      encoder         : Lavc58.134.100 libmp3lame\n","size=    5556kB time=00:05:55.51 bitrate= 128.0kbits/s speed=27.4x    \n","video:0kB audio:5556kB subtitle:0kB other streams:0kB global headers:0kB muxing overhead: 0.007541%\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"iB8M2U8fgSZG","outputId":"74dd4e2c-6793-4d76-f85b-cf04d34e4706","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728487667457,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":37655,"user":{"displayName":"Kempsly Silencieux","userId":"00710149443443216664"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["TranscriptionVerbose(duration=840.4299926757812, language='english', text=\"I'm going to walk you through how to create a company logo with Stable Diffusion for free in your Google Colab notebook. So this is the Stable Diffusion Google Colab. They set this up so you can run this in the Google environment. You don't need to download anything onto your computer. So it's much easier to run and it also gives you a free GPU, which is like a specialized computer that's very good at running this type of thing quickly. So I'm just going to click create a copy to drive and then that's going to create a copy. It's just creating a copy right now. It might take a couple of minutes. Okay a copy is created and we're basically just going to go through this setup process here. Now we have this copy, we can call it whatever I want. It's this is ours now and we can just run this. It says it requires higher RAM. Don't worry about that. Okay, I'm just going to get rid of any other sessions, whatever. So hopefully this will run now to connect. So that is connecting. Just to make sure that you're doing this the right way, you can just go to change run time type. So you see this hardware accelerator GPU, that's what you need to make sure is set to GPU. Okay, now we're connected and it says we've got this computer set up here. Okay, cool. Now we can run this. Okay, that's run fine and then we're just going to go through and run these in turn. So as this is running, you might want to set up a Hugging Face account. So in order to do this, you need to go open this model card up here and you can see I'm logged in to Hugging Face, but if you're not logged in, you'll see something like this. Here we go, you'll see the model card and then once you sign up, it will kind of ask you to approve that model card. So once you've done that, then you should be good in order to run it. So that's run and then we're going to create this, we're just going to run this as that lets you kind of customize the output widgets and then this is going to log you into Hugging Face. Okay, so once you have a Hugging Face account, you can click on that and then you see I have this token here, you can click copy token or if you need to create a new one, just name it and change it to write and generate the token. So I've got that one here, so I can copy that and then paste it in there and then click log in and that will give you this error, but you don't need to worry about that. If you get this error, then you know it's working, cool. So now we just need to download all the kind of model stuff, don't worry too much about what's happening here, it's basically downloading this disabled diffusion model from Hugging Face, which is kind of like a platform that holds all these models and datasets that you can use. So lots of really cool stuff on there and it's free to use as well, so a really, really good way to get started with AI. Okay, so this is downloading, the next thing we're going to have to do once it's downloaded is set up this pipe, so this is basically how it runs everything on the GPU rather than like on a normal computer and like I said before, GPUs are kind of optimized to do AI really well and normally they're very expensive to buy, like thousands of dollars, so really cool that Google offers this for free, although they are starting to try and get people to upgrade to the pro version, so I don't know how much longer this will be free. Okay, so it's downloading all this stuff here, I'm just going to take a little bit of time, I'm just going to pause it while it's downloading. Okay, that only took a few minutes to download and then I'm just going to run this pipe. So when you're running these things, you need to click play or what I'm doing is pressing shift and enter when I'm selected in this code. So now we are ready to create our first image and in order to create an image, we just need a few things, one is the prompt, so this is the prompt that gave you a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse and then it uses this with auto casting to basically run this on the GPU, we'll run faster and then it's going to grab the image and then save the image or you can display it here because we're in Google Colab, so let's try this and see what we get. So what it's doing is doing diffusion, so the way this works is it's starting with a completely random noisy image and then it's running an encoder that basically denoises the picture, so if you ever restored an old photograph, it denoises it and then it's trying to basically denoise it in a way that it matches this prompt, so it has another piece that says, does this match a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse and if it doesn't, then it'll keep moving in that direction until you get something like this. Cool, so it actually worked, we have a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse and you can do this in DALI, which is the open AI version, but because Stable Diffusion is open source, it's free pretty much to run it, so obviously you can pay more for more compute power, if you throw more compute power at it, the images get better, but it's pretty cool to just try it out in here and then if you do want to use a paid version that's maybe a bit more accurate, then you could use DALI after you've kind of figured out what prompts work. So now in this section, I'm going to use a manual seed and what manual seed does is it means this kind of starts the prompt, it starts the noisy image at a certain level of random noise and that means that if anyone who runs the same seed and the same prompt will get the exact same image every time, so before you saw that image of an astronaut riding a horse, whereas this one came up with a new image when we ran it, this one should bring us back the exact same image, so this is really useful, yeah here we go, it's the exact same image, so this is really useful for reproducibility and all you need to do is kind of set the generator here and then push the generator in to the pipe like that. Cool, the other thing we can do is kind of choose how many steps, so I think the default is 100, but you could set it to be less or more, so this is still setting that manual seed like we said before, it's the exact same image but we're doing it with less steps and that's where you can kind of see how compute makes a big difference to the problem. It also takes less time to run if you have less steps, so play around with that and kind of get an intuition for how much kind of computing power is needed to get the quality that you need. Cool, so the other thing we're going to do here is just generate three different images at once, so this is just a function that they've given you to create a grid and then when you run it you can get three different images now, so it's basically running it one, two, three different images and it's going to come out the other side and put three different images out there, so this is what you kind of expect from DALI or Midjourney or any of the other crayon if you've used that, because they give you a grid of images and this is doing the same thing. I'm just going to pause while that's running. Cool, so that took 40 seconds to run and you can see some are much better than others, like this looks like a video game, this doesn't have a horse in it, but this one looks great actually, like a really cool picture. Cool, and then you can create as many images as you want, like this is running it I guess for 12 images, so quite a few. That's going to take a long time to run, probably not going to do that, and there's obviously more you can do. This tutorial keeps going on, tells you how to change the height and width if you want, these have to be divisible by eight just to run into an error otherwise. It also explains a lot more about how the model works, which is interesting, but we're here to do a job, which is to create a new company logo. So let's do that and we're going to take this and we're just going to copy the cell and then paste the cell again, don't need to import Torch anymore. We're not going to do this generator, so we're not going to set a random seed. Actually, let me set a random seed just so you can get the same image as me if you want to use it for some reason. Cool, and number of inference steps, we're going to dial this up to 200 because we want to get a pretty good quality image. I found it, probably the most you can get it to is like 250. I think when I do 300, it starts to complain at me. I need to use a bigger computer probably. Cool, so what do we want? So we have a shaving brand called Ultra and it's a men's grooming brand. They do shaving foam, deodorant, and we want to create a new logo for them. So, you know, we could say new logo for a new company logo for men's shaving brand Ultra, and we could see what that comes back with. Let's see, yeah. Cool. Okay, that only took a minute to run and we got a pretty cool logo actually. One thing you'll notice is that the words never make any sense unless you're using tons and tons of inference steps. This is just a, you know, a problem with the model in general as you get the same thing in DALI as well, but like that's not what we want. We want this logo here and what you can do is, you know, now you can kind of save the image if you want. So we can take that code up here, yeah, image, save, and then so if you like this you can say Ultra logo and then in your files it's going to show up in theory. Oh, here we go. Now it's there. Cool, and then you can just download that and you'll get it on your local computer, and then what I think this is really good for is just ideation. Like it probably won't be the final version, although in theory you could use that. Depends on how early stage your brand is, like how much of a quality you need, but you can kind of drop this into Photoshop or Figma, kind of edit out the words, and then you've got like the logo that you need and kind of work on it from there. So the really cool thing here is that you as a non-technical, like non-design, non-creative person, you can actually create your own logo for free and, you know, try lots of different styles until you find what you like, and then go use a human, right? Like it's going to be a much easier brief for the designer if you just say, this is what I like, can you make like a better version of this? Then that's going to save them doing tons and tons of legwork just trying to second guess what you want, because now you can visually show them the style that you need. So it should, you know, bring down the cost of working with the designer by, you know, 10x. All right, hopefully that was useful.\", segments=[TranscriptionSegment(id=0, avg_logprob=-0.26389920711517334, compression_ratio=1.6296296119689941, end=5.559999942779541,

Here’s a breakdown of what each part does:\n","\n","### Code Breakdown\n","\n","1. **Opening the Audio File**:\n","   ```python\n","   audio_file = open(\"output.mp3\", \"rb\")\n","   ```\n","   - This line opens the MP3 file `output.mp3` in binary read mode (`\"rb\"`). The `audio_file` variable now holds a file object that can be passed to the transcription function.\n","\n","2. **Transcribing the Audio**:\n","   ```python\n","   transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(model=\"whisper-1\", file=audio_file, response_format=\"verbose_json\")\n","   ```\n","   - Here, `client.audio.transcriptions.create` is called to initiate the transcription process.\n","   - The `model` parameter specifies the model to use, which is `whisper-1` in this case. This model is known for its ability to transcribe audio with high accuracy.\n","   - The `file` parameter is set to `audio_file`, which contains the audio data to be transcribed.\n","   - The `response_format` is set to `verbose_json`, indicating that the response will include detailed transcription results in JSON format.\n","\n","3. **Printing the Transcription**:\n","   ```python\n","   print(transcript)\n","   ```\n","   - Finally, this line prints the transcription results, which will include the transcribed text along with additional metadata, such as the duration of the audio, the confidence score, and possibly speaker labels if applicable.\n","\n","### What to Expect from the Output\n","\n","The `transcript` object will likely contain various pieces of information:\n","- **Transcribed Text**: The actual spoken words from the audio file.\n","- **Duration**: How long the audio file was.\n","- **Confidence Score**: A metric indicating how confident the model is about the transcription.\n","- **Additional Metadata**: Depending on the implementation, you may receive speaker differentiation or other relevant data.\n","\n","### Example Usage\n","\n","This setup is useful for applications in:\n","- **Content Creation**: Automating the transcription of podcasts, interviews, or lectures.\n","- **Accessibility**: Creating transcripts for video content to assist the hearing impaired.\n","- **Data Analysis**: Converting spoken data into text for further processing and analysis."],"metadata":{"id":"ZIA_LAab5rSA"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"id":"HpydkNSyGnqI","outputId":"183b6867-0885-488f-dd0d-8f34ea293523","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728488530757,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":309,"user":{"displayName":"Kempsly

 I'm going to walk you through how to create a company logo with Stable Diffusion for free\n","00:06 -  in your Google Colab notebook.\n","00:09 -  So this is the Stable Diffusion Google Colab.\n","00:14 -  They set this up so you can run this in the Google environment.\n","00:17 -  You don't need to download anything onto your computer.\n","00:20 -  So it's much easier to run and it also gives you a free GPU, which is like a specialized\n","00:25 -  computer that's very good at running this type of thing quickly.\n","00:29 -  So I'm just going to click create a copy to drive and then that's going to create a\n","00:38 -  copy.\n","00:39 -  It's just creating a copy right now.\n","00:40 -  It might take a couple of minutes.\n","00:50 -  Okay a copy is created and we're basically just going to go through this setup process\n","00:55 -  here.\n","00:56 -  Now we have this copy, we can call it whatever I want.\n","00:59 -  It's this is ours now and we can just run this.\n","01:04 -  It says it requires higher RAM.\n","01:06 -  Don't worry about that.\n","01:07 -  Okay, I'm just going to get rid of any other sessions, whatever.\n","01:19 -  So hopefully this will run now to connect.\n","01:28 -  So that is connecting.\n","01:30 -  Just to make sure that you're doing this the right way, you can just go to change run time\n","01:36 -  type.\n","01:37 -  So you see this hardware accelerator GPU, that's what you need to make sure is set to\n","01:42 -  GPU.\n","01:43 -  Okay, now we're connected and it says we've got this computer set up here.\n","01:47 -  Okay, cool.\n","01:48 -  Now we can run this.\n","01:49 -  Okay, that's run fine and then we're just going to go through and run these in turn.\n","01:57 -  So as this is running, you might want to set up a Hugging Face account.\n","02:05 -  So in order to do this, you need to go open this model card up here and you can see I'm\n","02:13 -  logged in to Hugging Face, but if you're not logged in, you'll see something like this.\n","02:22 -  Here we go, you'll see the model card and then once you sign up, it will kind of ask\n","02:31 -  you to approve that model card.\n","02:34 -  So once you've done that, then you should be good in order to run it.\n","02:42 -  So that's run and then we're going to create this, we're just going to run this as that\n","02:50 -  lets you kind of customize the output widgets and then this is going to log you into Hugging\n","02:56 -  Face.\n","02:57 -  Okay, so once you have a Hugging Face account, you can click on that and then you see I have\n","03:02 -  this token here, you can click copy token or if you need to create a new one, just name\n","03:06 -  it and change it to write and generate the token.\n","03:10 -  So I've got that one here, so I can copy that and then paste it in there and then click\n","03:17 -  log in and that will give you this error, but you don't need to worry about that.\n","03:22 -  If you get this error, then you know it's working, cool.\n","03:26 -  So now we just need to download all the kind of model stuff, don't worry too much about\n","03:32 -  what's happening here, it's basically downloading this disabled diffusion model from Hugging\n","03:35 -  Face, which is kind of like a platform that holds all these models and datasets that you\n","03:43 -  can use.\n","03:45 -  So lots of really cool stuff on there and it's free to use as well, so a really, really\n","03:52 -  good way to get started with AI.\n","03:54 -  Okay, so this is downloading, the next thing we're going to have to do once it's downloaded\n","03:59 -  is set up this pipe, so this is basically how it runs everything on the GPU rather than\n","04:06 -  like on a normal computer and like I said before, GPUs are kind of optimized to do AI\n","04:13 -  really well and normally they're very expensive to buy, like thousands of dollars, so really\n","04:20 -  cool that Google offers this for free, although they are starting to try and get people to\n","04:27 -  upgrade to the pro version, so I don't know how much longer this will be free.\n","04:31 -  Okay, so it's downloading all this stuff here, I'm just going to take a little bit of time,\n","04:36 -  I'm just going to pause it while it's downloading.\n","04:40 -  Okay, that only took a few minutes to download and then I'm just going to run this pipe.\n","04:46 -  So when you're running these things, you need to click play or what I'm doing is pressing\n","04:50 -  shift and enter when I'm selected in this code.\n","04:55 -  So now we are ready to create our first image and in order to create an image, we just need\n","05:01 -  a few things, one is the prompt, so this is the prompt that gave you a photograph of an\n","05:05 -  astronaut riding a horse and then it uses this with auto casting to basically run this\n","05:13 -  on the GPU, we'll run faster and then it's going to grab the image and then save the\n","05:20 -  image or you can display it here because we're in Google Colab, so let's try this and see what we get.\n","05:33 -  So what it's doing is doing diffusion, so the way this works is it's starting with a\n","05:40 -  completely random noisy image and then it's running an encoder that basically\n","05:49 -  denoises the picture, so if you ever restored an old photograph, it denoises it and then\n","05:55 -  it's trying to basically denoise it in a way that it matches this prompt, so it has\n","06:05 -  another piece that says, does this match a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse\n","06:09 -  and if it doesn't, then it'll keep moving in that direction until you get something like this.\n","06:15 -  Cool, so it actually worked, we have a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse\n","06:20 -  and you can do this in DALI, which is the open AI version, but because\n","06:28 -  Stable Diffusion is open source, it's free pretty much to run it, so\n","06:34 -  obviously you can pay more for more compute power, if you throw more compute power at it, the images\n","06:39 -  get better, but it's pretty cool to just try it out in here and then if you do want to use a paid\n","06:46 -  version that's maybe a bit more accurate, then you could use DALI after you've kind of figured out\n","06:52 -  what prompts work. So now in this section, I'm going to use a manual seed and what manual seed does\n","07:01 -  is it means this kind of starts the prompt, it starts the noisy image at a certain\n","07:08 -  level of random noise and that means that if anyone who runs the same seed and the same\n","07:15 -  prompt will get the exact same image every time, so before you saw that image of an astronaut riding a\n","07:21 -  horse, whereas this one came up with a new image when we ran it, this one should bring us\n","07:27 -  back the exact same image, so this is really useful, yeah here we go, it's the exact same image, so this is\n","07:32 -  really useful for reproducibility and all you need to do is kind of set the generator here\n","07:37 -  and then push the generator in to the pipe like that. Cool, the other thing we can do\n","07:47 -  is kind of choose how many steps, so I think the default is 100, but you could set it\n","07:53 -  to be less or more, so this is still setting that manual seed like we said before, it's the exact\n","07:60 -  same image but we're doing it with less steps and that's where you can kind of see\n","08:06 -  how compute makes a big difference to the problem. It also takes less time to run if you have less\n","08:12 -  steps, so play around with that and kind of get an intuition for how much kind of computing\n","08:19 -  power is needed to get the quality that you need. Cool, so the other thing we're going to do here is\n","08:26 -  just generate three different images at once, so this is just a function that they've given you\n","08:31 -  to create a grid and then when you run it you can get three different images now, so it's\n","08:38 -  basically running it one, two, three different images and it's going to come out the other side\n","08:48 -  and put three different images out there, so this is what you kind of expect from\n","08:54 -  DALI or Midjourney or any of the other crayon if you've used that, because they give you\n","09:01 -  a grid of images and this is doing the same thing. I'm just going to pause while that's running.\n","09:07 -  Cool, so that took 40 seconds to run and you can see some are much better than others, like\n","09:13 -  this looks like a video game, this doesn't have a horse in it, but this one\n","09:17 -  looks great actually, like a really cool picture. Cool, and then you can create as many\n","09:23 -  images as you want, like this is running it I guess for 12 images, so quite a few.\n","09:32 -  That's going to take a long time to run, probably not going to do that,\n","09:38 -  and there's obviously more you can do. This tutorial keeps going on, tells you how to\n","09:44 -  change the height and width if you want, these have to be divisible by eight just to\n","09:49 -  run into an error otherwise. It also explains a lot more about how the model works,\n","09:54 -  which is interesting, but we're here to do a job, which is to create a new company logo.\n","09:60 -  So let's do that and we're going to take this and we're just going to\n","10:07 -  copy the cell and then paste the cell again, don't need to import Torch anymore.\n","10:16 -  We're not going to do this generator, so we're not going to set a random seed.\n","10:25 -  Actually, let me set a random seed just so you can get the same image as me if you want to use it\n","10:30 -  for some reason. Cool, and number of inference steps, we're going to dial this up to 200\n","10:36 -  because we want to get a pretty good quality image.\n","10:45 -  I found it, probably the most you can get it to is like 250. I think when I do 300,\n","10:49 -  it starts to complain at me. I need to use a bigger computer probably.\n","10:54 -  Cool, so what do we want? So we have a shaving brand called Ultra and it's a men's grooming\n","11:01 -  brand. They do shaving foam, deodorant, and we want to create a new logo for them.\n","11:08 -  So, you know, we could say new logo for a new company logo for men's shaving brand Ultra,\n","11:23 -  and we could see what that comes back with. Let's see, yeah.\n","11:31 -  Cool. Okay, that only took a minute to run and we got a pretty cool logo actually.\n","11:41 -  One thing you'll notice is that the words never make any sense unless you're using tons and tons\n","11:47 -  of inference steps. This is just a, you know, a problem with the model in general as you get the\n","11:53 -  same thing in DALI as well, but like that's not what we want. We want this logo here and what\n","11:59 -  you can do is, you know, now you can kind of save the image if you want. So we can take that code\n","12:08 -  up here, yeah, image, save, and then so if you like this you can say\n","12:18 -  Ultra logo and then in your files it's going to show up in theory.\n","12:41 -  Oh, here we go. Now it's there. Cool, and then you can just download that\n","12:45 -  and you'll get it on your local computer, and then what I think this is really good for is\n","12:51 -  just ideation. Like it probably won't be the final version, although in theory you could use that.\n","12:56 -  Depends on how early stage your brand is, like how much of a quality you need, but you can kind\n","13:03 -  of drop this into Photoshop or Figma, kind of edit out the words, and then you've got like the logo\n","13:09 -  that you need and kind of work on it from there. So the really cool thing here is that\n","13:16 -  you as a non-technical, like non-design, non-creative person, you can actually create\n","13:23 -  your own logo for free and, you know, try lots of different styles until you find what you like,\n","13:29 -  and then go use a human, right? Like it's going to be a much easier brief for the designer\n","13:36 -  if you just say, this is what I like, can you make like a better version of this?\n","13:42 -  Then that's going to save them doing tons and tons of legwork just trying to second guess what you\n","13:46 -  want, because now you can visually show them the style that you need. So it should, you know,\n","13:53 -  bring down the cost of working with the designer by, you know, 10x. All right, hopefully that was\n","13:59 -  useful.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["transcript_sinach.segments"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gFcgLnqW9lJm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728488830186,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":264,"user":{"displayName":"Kempsly
