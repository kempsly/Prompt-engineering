Do you think people see you in a different light when \\nyou have designer clothes on? \\nJ: I don't know it's just how people see me 'cause that's what I just wear pretty much \\nall the time so that's how people see me. \\nI: OK and the other thing is women [how I see myself]. Now you've used women who \\nare not wearing an awful lo t// \\nJ: //yeah. \\n\\nI: Is it women and girls in general that you \\nlike, or can you give me an example of any \\nwomen that you think are particularly nice? \\nJ: It's not just like any group because you can get proper ugly people, like attractive \\nwomen. \\nI: So who do you class as attractive as an a ttractive wo man? \\n\\nJ: Jennifer Lopez and people like that. \\nI: Can you give me a couple of other names maybe? \\nJ: I don't know loads of people. \\n\\nI: Like. \\n\\nJ: Mariah Carey, I don't know people like that. \\n\\nI: What is it about them that you think makes them attractive and appealing to you? \\nJ: The way they look. \\nI: Who do you think isn't attractive? \\n\\nJ: I don't know, er well it just, not like fat people, er. \\n\\nI: Or are there any famous people that are d\\nescribed as pretty and you think, no they're \\nnot, I don't think they are// \\nJ: //yeah Madonna I don't reckon. \\nI: What about Paris Hilton? \\nJ: Yeah she's alright I guess. \\n\\nI: She's alright but she's not on the same level as Jennifer Lopez or Mariah Carey? \\n\\nJ: Yeah yeah. \\n\\nI: What about Beyonce// \\nJ: //yeah she's good looking. \\nI: She's good looking. \\n\\nJ: Yeah. \\n\\nI: So do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think \\nother people see you? \\nJ: Yeah probably. \\nI: Where would the differences be? What would it be? \\nJ: Well it's a person's point of view isn't it? \\n\\nI: But if you were going to explain it to me, can you think of maybe something that \\nsomebody else might think of you that you think that's not how I see myself? \\nJ: Er, quite like, I don't know bossy, I don't know. \\nI: Bossy. \\nJ: Yeah. \\n\\nI: Do you th ink other people see you as bossy? \\n\\nJ: Yeah they could do I don't know, I don't really know how other people see me. \\n\\nI: OK and just finally how you would usually describe your ethnicity// \\n\\nJ: //English. \\nI: Do you ever say British? \\nJ: Say if I went on holiday and they asked what region like nationality I'd probably say \\nEnglish, no British actually yeah. \\nI: What's the difference between English and British? \\n\\nJ: I don't know it's just some people say English and some people say British, it's like \\nsome people say tomato and some people say tomato. \\nI: Are they both the same thing? \\n\\nJ: Yeah. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n409\\nI: They are? \\nJ: Mmm. \\n\\nI: OK cool. \\n \\n(H=Helen, aged 14, female; I=interviewer) \\n\\n\\n\\nI: Is this one collage or is it two separate collages? \\n\\nH: Two kind of like, in the middle there's mixing. \\n\\nI: So let's start with how you see yourself. Do you want to go through the images and \\nexplain what you're trying to express and represent with each of the images? \\nH: OK. I put sport on there 'cause I like play sport and I like sport. I like gossip and to \\nothers I like talking about people. \\nI: Right. \\n\\nH: I put a picture of the country where I live in and a circle round the bit Bournemouth \\nand that. I put a picture of London because I go up there quite a bit, and I put a \\npicture of pink GHD's [hair straighteners] because I can't live without them and a \\n\\npicture of a cat 'cause I like cats and Ri ver Island 'cause I like I love River Island. \\nI: You said you like talking about other people// \\n\\nH: //yeah. \\nI: What is it about that that you like and enjoy? \\nH: Don't know, just like talking about people. \\n\\nI: Do you think that's it's OK to talk about \\npeople in a gossipy way if you're saying bad \\nthings about them? \\nH: Not really but. \\n\\nI: You still do it. \\nH: Yeah. \\nI: So y ou are quite into fashion and you like clothes// \\n\\nH: //yeah. \\n\\nI: Is it important for you to feel like you are a fashionable person and taking care of the \\nway that you look? \\nH: Er y eah kind of. \\nI: Let's move on to how you think other people see you. Do you want to explain them \\ni mages and what you are trying to represent? \\nH: Yeah, I put \\u201aattitude' [word] because I thi\\nnk that sometimes I can have a bit of an \\nattitude towards other people. \\nI: Right. \\nH: And I think some people think I'm a bit gobby as well. I put a picture of \\nFriends\\n \\n[American sitcom], because I'm like always with my friends. \\nI: You've put a picture of? \\n\\nH: \\nFriends\\n. \\nI: Right. \\nH: I'm always on the run and can't sit still fo\\nr ages, and I put like sparkly so it's like \\nbubbly sort of thing. \\nI: Right, and in the middle you' ve put \\u201aI am what I am' [words]. So do you feel that \\nthis could be one collage? \\nH: Yes. \\n\\nI: Do you th ink how yo u think other people see you is how you see yourself? \\nH: Yeah. \\nI: Or do you think there's a difference? \\n\\nH: I think it's mainly same really. \\n\\nI: Do you think that there are any differences though, like if you had more time to work \\non this [how I think other people see me] \\ndo you think that there would be any \\ndifferences between the two sides? \\nH: Yeah definitely if I had more time. \\n\\nI: What do you the differences would be? \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n410\\nH: I don't know, um, I'm not sure. \\nI: You're not sure. \\n\\nH: No. \\nI: OK and just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? \\nH: British. \\n\\nI: Now do you always say British or do you say English? \\n\\nH: Either. \\n\\nI: Either. \\n\\nH: Yeah. \\nI: What one do you use more often? \\nH: Probably English. \\n\\nI: English. \\n\\nH: Yeah. \\n\\nI: Is there a difference between English and British or are they the same? \\nH: They're the same, I think so. I think \\nthey're the same, just two words the same. \\nI: So it's just two different words for the same thing? \\n\\nH: Yeah. \\n\\nI: OK that's brilliant. \\n\\n \\n(N=Nancy, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) \\n\\n\\nI: Is this one collage or is it two? \\n\\nN: Probably one. \\n\\nI: Do you want to go through the images and explain what you are trying to express \\nwith them? \\nN: Yeah the dog is that I \\ndon't like animal cruelty becau\\nse like underneath it it's a bit \\nlike he's really lonely and everything 'cau\\nse I don't like how animals are treated like \\nwhen they've make-up tested on them. \\nI: Right. \\n\\nN: I think I'm quite happy , I like listening \\nto mu sic, I just like the brightness of the \\nflower I think I'm quite like, not bright like clever but// \\nI: //bright as in an uplifting character// \\n\\nN: //yeah yeah I like my mobile, I really want that car when I'm older and that's where I \\nlive [image of UK map]. I think I respect people and that, and I'm quite calm// \\nI: //so you've used the candle to represent calm// \\n\\nN: //yeah, and I gossip quite a lot about things like what you see on tele and that lot and I \\nthink people can trust me like if they want \\nto say something like that no-one else \\nwants to know, I keep a secret and that lot so. \\nI: Right. You've mentioned animal cruelty// \\n\\nN: //yeah// \\n\\nI: //which you think is not acceptable, why do you think it's wrong? \\nN: 'Cause no-one likes it when kids are trea\\nted badly so why should animals be treated \\nbadly because, I know they haven't obviously got the same feelings as us but they \\n\\nknow when the owners are doing something ho\\nrrible to them when they haven't done \\nanything wrong, like little children, like you know the NHS I think it is// \\nI: //yes// \\n\\nN: //they get treated, children go there 'cau\\nse they get treated badly so why should dogs \\nget treated badly as well. \\nI: Also you said that you like mu sic, wh at mu sic in particular do you mo st identify \\nwith? \\nN: Pop. \\n\\nI: Are there any artists in particular that you// \\nN: //not really , just like any kind of musi\\nc, not rock, I don't really like rock. \\nI: What is it about rock\\n that you don't like? \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n411\\nN: It's that head banging if you know what I \\nmean, there's not like a lot of singing it's \\njust like music like noise. \\nI: So what is it about pop that you like? \\nN: Some of the words and that are quite good. \\nI: Now I've noticed on your collage// \\n\\nN: //yeah// \\n\\nI: //I sort of get the impression that y\\nou're quite a happy, bubbly type of person// \\nN: //yeah// \\n\\nI: //but what I've noticed is there is not anything here which suggests maybe you get a \\nlittle bit angry// \\nN: //y eah I couldn't find anything. \\n\\nI: If you had more time or if there were ot\\nher things that you wanted to express on this \\nabout yourself// \\nN: //yeah// \\nI: //what types of things would you put down? \\nN: I do get angry sometimes. \\n\\nI: What sorts of things make you angry? \\n\\nN: Animal cruelty if you see it on tele or li\\nke children, you know you see those children \\nadverts that don't have homes that makes \\nme upset and angry, I do n't understand why \\nthey like do that, people do that\\n to animals and their children. \\nI: So do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think \\nother people see you? \\nN: Yeah. \\n\\nI: What do you think the difference is? \\n\\nN: I think like some people see me, 'cause I don't obviously like, I think they think I'm \\nquite loud 'cause I do talk quite a lot so I think they think that but I'm not if you \\nknow what I mean. \\nI: Do you think it's more, when they hear you express yourself, do you think that maybe \\nthey think that you're confident? \\nN: Oh no, I'm not confident at all. \\nI: But do you think other people think you are? \\nN: Yeah, but when they get to know me they know I'm not, 'cause I work quite hard and \\nthat's why I worry a lot. \\nI: Why don't you let other people see that side of you? \\n\\nN: 'Cause I don't want them to think that\\n I'm like stupid or a whimp, 'cause I get \\nworried about a lot of things. \\nI: So, it's like you keeping that side to yourself// \\nN: //yeah but my mum knows that I get worried and I talk to her about it if I have any \\nproblems and that lot and some of my friends I do, people I don't know I don't say it \\n\\nstraight away but I wait until I get to know them. \\nI: So it's like a defence// \\nN: //y eah, y eah 'cause like if they think I'm \\nnot very clever they might not like me but \\nall my friends obviously they like me because they know I' m not. \\nI: Do you think if somebody didn't think you were clever and didn't like you off the \\nback of it// \\nN: //yeah// \\n\\nI: //do you think a person like that \\nwould be worth knowing at all// \\nN: //no not at all, they should like me for who I am not what I'm gonna do, like my work \\nand that lot. \\nI: But do you think it alway s works out that way ? \\n\\nN: No, 'cause like mostly you're really up\\nset if somebody doesn't like you so, 'cause \\nyou can't probably be as clever as they are. \\nI: You've not actually used many images of famous people// \\nN: //yeah, I didn't have enough time. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n412\\nI: But if you could, are there any people that you think you would have put on, that you \\nlook to who you think are positive role models? \\nN: Um. \\nI: Or somebody that you look to that you think I aspire to want to be like that. \\nN: Have you heard of um, I've co\\nmpletely forgotten her name now. \\nI: What's she in? \\n\\nN: She's a singer, I don't know her name. \\n\\nI: What does she look like? \\n\\nN: She's got like; she had brown now she's got blonde hair. \\nI: Kelly Clarkson? \\nN: That's it; I like her music a lot. \\n\\nI: What is it about Kelly Clarkson that you like and identify with? \\n\\nN: 'Cause on her videos when sings it's not \\nlike she just stands there, it's like she \\nexpresse s how she's feeling in the words th\\nat she says, she actually expresses herself \\nin the video she's not like just standing there singing it. \\nI: Is there anything else about her, not just her music but the type of person that you \\nthink she is// \\nN: //I think she's quite happy because I wa\\ntched an interview and she seemed quite \\nhappy and bubbly but I don't know if it's just for show, but she did seem happy and \\nwhat not so I think she's being true, so that's good. \\nI: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? \\n\\nN: I'm English. \\n\\nI: If you had the choice between Eng\\nlish or British, what would you say? \\nN: English, yeah. \\n\\nI: Do you think there's a difference though between English and British? \\nN: Yeah I think so. \\nI: What do you think the difference is? \\n\\nN: Is it just, aren't th ey like, 'cause British \\nis the whole country, no it's not, am I wrong? \\nI: What do you think? There's no right or wrong answer. \\n\\nN: No I don't know. \\nI: Are you going to say that you think British is the whole country including Scotland, \\nWales and No rthern Ireland, whereas England is just England// \\nN: //yeah// \\n\\nI: //so with England you are being more specific// \\n\\nN: //yeah// \\n\\nI: //about what country you come from// \\nN: //yeah. \\nI: OK that's brilliant.\",\n          \"I: Wow, you've got a lot on your collage. Where would you like to start with this? \\n\\nP: How other people think they see me as. \\n\\nI: OK, let's start this side [how I think \\nother people see me]. Now you've got quite a \\nfew images here of different women. What\\n does this head bit cut out on top of the \\nother body mean? \\nP: Some people just think I'm moody and I've got attitude. \\n\\nI: So some people think you're moody and that you've got attitude. \\n\\nP: Yeah. \\nI: What do all of these different faces mean? \\nP: That one says I'm confident [image of a girl in a yellow top]. \\n\\nI: Is that how you think other people see you, as confident? \\n\\nP: Yeah. Also friendly and funny \\n[various images of women's faces]. \\nI: What about this one [image of a black girl]? \\n\\nP: Pretty. \\nI: And what about that one [image of a girl looking up]? \\nP: I don't know, I just stuck it there. \\n\\nI: OK, you've also got \\u201aboring' [word]. \\n\\nP: Yeah, some people think I am boring. \\n\\nI: And what does this represent [image\\n of a champagne bottle in a bucket]? \\nP: That I'm lively. \\nI: That you're lively? \\n\\nP: Yeah. \\n\\nI: Is \\u201atalk too much' [words] this side to? \\n\\nP: Yeah. \\n\\nI: Now you've got pictures of somebody funny and confident, but then also moody, \\nattitude and boring. Do you think ot\\nher people see you as all those things? \\nP: Yeah, that's what I think. \\n\\nI: OK let's go onto this side [how I see myself]. What do these images mean? Let's \\nstart with the girl in the jeans. \\nP: Independent. \\nI: Independent. \\nP: Yeah. \\n\\nI: You've also though got the word \\u201abitch' with an arrow going to the independent. \\n\\nP: (laughter) No it's not supposed to go to there. \\n\\nI: So that wasn't deliberate? \\n\\nP: Yeah. \\nI: Do you think that this [independent] \\nis a positive quality or sometimes people think \\nit's negative? \\nP: What independent? \\n\\nI: Yes. \\n\\nP: Positive. \\nI: And what about these images [images of fashion items]? \\nP: I just like going out and shopping and thing and buy ing clothes for me. \\n\\nI: So you like your fashion and accessories? \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n431\\nP: Yeah. \\nI: And you've also got the words \\u201anice' and \\u201astar' and you've got \\u201agoing-out' there. \\nNow on this side [how I see my self], looking \\nat it, it seems very positive but on this \\nside [how I think other people see me] yo u've got \\u201aquiet', \\u201aboring', \\u201amoody', \\n\\u201aattitude'. Do you think that other people r\\neally know who you are, what type of \\nperson you are? \\nP: Most of them don't. \\n\\nI: Why do you think that that might be? \\n\\nP: Because I' m different around them. \\nI: In what way? \\nP: Quiet, bitchy. \\n\\nI: What was that? Bitchy// \\n\\nP: //to Kelly [pupil]. Sometimes I'm evil to people \\n\\nI: OK. If you could have used more images on your collage are there any pictures you \\nwould have liked to have been able put on? \\nP: No. \\n\\nI: So you think this summaries, this sums up \\nwhat were you were trying to express quite \\nwell. \\nP: Yeah. \\nI: That's great. So finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? \\nP: I don't know. \\n\\nI: Last week you wrote// \\n\\nP: //I was black. \\n\\nI: Would you ever describe your ethnicity as British? \\n\\nP: No. \\nI: Why not? \\nP: I don't know. \\n\\nI: Were you born in this country? \\n\\nP: Yeah. \\n\\nI: So you always describe yourself as black? \\nP: Yeah. \\nI: And you would never describe yourself as British? \\n\\nP: I would, but I'm confused.

What would it be? \\nJ: Well it's a person's point of view isn't it? \\n\\nI: But if you were going to explain it to me, can you think of maybe something that \\nsomebody else might think of you that you think that's not how I see myself? \\nJ: Er, quite like, I don't know bossy, I don't know. \\nI: Bossy. \\nJ: Yeah. \\n\\nI: Do you th ink other people see you as bossy? \\n\\nJ: Yeah they could do I don't know, I don't really know how other people see me. \\n\\nI: OK and just finally how you would usually describe your ethnicity// \\n\\nJ: //English. \\nI: Do you ever say British? \\nJ: Say if I went on holiday and they asked what region like nationality I'd probably say \\nEnglish, no British actually yeah. \\nI: What's the difference between English and British? \\n\\nJ: I don't know it's just some people say English and some people say British, it's like \\nsome people say tomato and some people say tomato. \\nI: Are they both the same thing? \\n\\nJ: Yeah. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n409\\nI: They are? \\nJ: Mmm. \\n\\nI: OK cool. \\n \\n(H=Helen, aged 14, female; I=interviewer) \\n\\n\\n\\nI: Is this one collage or is it two separate collages? \\n\\nH: Two kind of like, in the middle there's mixing. \\n\\nI: So let's start with how you see yourself. Do you want to go through the images and \\nexplain what you're trying to express and represent with each of the images? \\nH: OK. I put sport on there 'cause I like play sport and I like sport. I like gossip and to \\nothers I like talking about people. \\nI: Right. \\n\\nH: I put a picture of the country where I live in and a circle round the bit Bournemouth \\nand that. I put a picture of London because I go up there quite a bit, and I put a \\npicture of pink GHD's [hair straighteners] because I can't live without them and a \\n\\npicture of a cat 'cause I like cats and Ri ver Island 'cause I like I love River Island. \\nI: You said you like talking about other people// \\n\\nH: //yeah. \\nI: What is it about that that you like and enjoy? \\nH: Don't know, just like talking about people. \\n\\nI: Do you think that's it's OK to talk about \\npeople in a gossipy way if you're saying bad \\nthings about them? \\nH: Not really but. \\n\\nI: You still do it. \\nH: Yeah. \\nI: So y ou are quite into fashion and you like clothes// \\n\\nH: //yeah. \\n\\nI: Is it important for you to feel like you are a fashionable person and taking care of the \\nway that you look? \\nH: Er y eah kind of. \\nI: Let's move on to how you think other people see you. Do you want to explain them \\ni mages and what you are trying to represent? \\nH: Yeah, I put \\u201aattitude' [word] because I thi\\nnk that sometimes I can have a bit of an \\nattitude towards other people. \\nI: Right. \\nH: And I think some people think I'm a bit gobby as well. I put a picture of \\nFriends\\n \\n[American sitcom], because I'm like always with my friends. \\nI: You've put a picture of? \\n\\nH: \\nFriends\\n. \\nI: Right. \\nH: I'm always on the run and can't sit still fo\\nr ages, and I put like sparkly so it's like \\nbubbly sort of thing. \\nI: Right, and in the middle you' ve put \\u201aI am what I am' [words]. So do you feel that \\nthis could be one collage? \\nH: Yes. \\n\\nI: Do you th ink how yo u think other people see you is how you see yourself? \\nH: Yeah. \\nI: Or do you think there's a difference? \\n\\nH: I think it's mainly same really. \\n\\nI: Do you think that there are any differences though, like if you had more time to work \\non this [how I think other people see me] \\ndo you think that there would be any \\ndifferences between the two sides? \\nH: Yeah definitely if I had more time. \\n\\nI: What do you the differences would be? \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n410\\nH: I don't know, um, I'm not sure. \\nI: You're not sure. \\n\\nH: No. \\nI: OK and just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? \\nH: British. \\n\\nI: Now do you always say British or do you say English? \\n\\nH: Either. \\n\\nI: Either. \\n\\nH: Yeah. \\nI: What one do you use more often? \\nH: Probably English. \\n\\nI: English. \\n\\nH: Yeah. \\n\\nI: Is there a difference between English and British or are they the same? \\nH: They're the same, I think so. I think \\nthey're the same, just two words the same. \\nI: So it's just two different words for the same thing? \\n\\nH: Yeah. \\n\\nI: OK that's brilliant. \\n\\n \\n(N=Nancy, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) \\n\\n\\nI: Is this one collage or is it two? \\n\\nN: Probably one. \\n\\nI: Do you want to go through the images and explain what you are trying to express \\nwith them? \\nN: Yeah the dog is that I \\ndon't like animal cruelty becau\\nse like underneath it it's a bit \\nlike he's really lonely and everything 'cau\\nse I don't like how animals are treated like \\nwhen they've make-up tested on them. \\nI: Right. \\n\\nN: I think I'm quite happy , I like listening \\nto mu sic, I just like the brightness of the \\nflower I think I'm quite like, not bright like clever but// \\nI: //bright as in an uplifting character// \\n\\nN: //yeah yeah I like my mobile, I really want that car when I'm older and that's where I \\nlive [image of UK map]. I think I respect people and that, and I'm quite calm// \\nI: //so you've used the candle to represent calm// \\n\\nN: //yeah, and I gossip quite a lot about things like what you see on tele and that lot and I \\nthink people can trust me like if they want \\nto say something like that no-one else \\nwants to know, I keep a secret and that lot so. \\nI: Right. You've mentioned animal cruelty// \\n\\nN: //yeah// \\n\\nI: //which you think is not acceptable, why do you think it's wrong? \\nN: 'Cause no-one likes it when kids are trea\\nted badly so why should animals be treated \\nbadly because, I know they haven't obviously got the same feelings as us but they \\n\\nknow when the owners are doing something ho\\nrrible to them when they haven't done \\nanything wrong, like little children, like you know the NHS I think it is// \\nI: //yes// \\n\\nN: //they get treated, children go there 'cau\\nse they get treated badly so why should dogs \\nget treated badly as well. \\nI: Also you said that you like mu sic, wh at mu sic in particular do you mo st identify \\nwith? \\nN: Pop. \\n\\nI: Are there any artists in particular that you// \\nN: //not really , just like any kind of musi\\nc, not rock, I don't really like rock. \\nI: What is it about rock\\n that you don't like? \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n411\\nN: It's that head banging if you know what I \\nmean, there's not like a lot of singing it's \\njust like music like noise. \\nI: So what is it about pop that you like? \\nN: Some of the words and that are quite good. \\nI: Now I've noticed on your collage// \\n\\nN: //yeah// \\n\\nI: //I sort of get the impression that y\\nou're quite a happy, bubbly type of person// \\nN: //yeah// \\n\\nI: //but what I've noticed is there is not anything here which suggests maybe you get a \\nlittle bit angry// \\nN: //y eah I couldn't find anything. \\n\\nI: If you had more time or if there were ot\\nher things that you wanted to express on this \\nabout yourself// \\nN: //yeah// \\nI: //what types of things would you put down? \\nN: I do get angry sometimes. \\n\\nI: What sorts of things make you angry? \\n\\nN: Animal cruelty if you see it on tele or li\\nke children, you know you see those children \\nadverts that don't have homes that makes \\nme upset and angry, I do n't understand why \\nthey like do that, people do that\\n to animals and their children. \\nI: So do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think \\nother people see you? \\nN: Yeah. \\n\\nI: What do you think the difference is? \\n\\nN: I think like some people see me, 'cause I don't obviously like, I think they think I'm \\nquite loud 'cause I do talk quite a lot so I think they think that but I'm not if you \\nknow what I mean. \\nI: Do you think it's more, when they hear you express yourself, do you think that maybe \\nthey think that you're confident? \\nN: Oh no, I'm not confident at all. \\nI: But do you think other people think you are? \\nN: Yeah, but when they get to know me they know I'm not, 'cause I work quite hard and \\nthat's why I worry a lot. \\nI: Why don't you let other people see that side of you? \\n\\nN: 'Cause I don't want them to think that\\n I'm like stupid or a whimp, 'cause I get \\nworried about a lot of things. \\nI: So, it's like you keeping that side to yourself// \\nN: //yeah but my mum knows that I get worried and I talk to her about it if I have any \\nproblems and that lot and some of my friends I do, people I don't know I don't say it \\n\\nstraight away but I wait until I get to know them. \\nI: So it's like a defence// \\nN: //y eah, y eah 'cause like if they think I'm \\nnot very clever they might not like me but \\nall my friends obviously they like me because they know I' m not. \\nI: Do you think if somebody didn't think you were clever and didn't like you off the \\nback of it// \\nN: //yeah// \\n\\nI: //do you think a person like that \\nwould be worth knowing at all// \\nN: //no not at all, they should like me for who I am not what I'm gonna do, like my work \\nand that lot. \\nI: But do you think it alway s works out that way ? \\n\\nN: No, 'cause like mostly you're really up\\nset if somebody doesn't like you so, 'cause \\nyou can't probably be as clever as they are. \\nI: You've not actually used many images of famous people// \\nN: //yeah, I didn't have enough time. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n412\\nI: But if you could, are there any people that you think you would have put on, that you \\nlook to who you think are positive role models? \\nN: Um. \\nI: Or somebody that you look to that you think I aspire to want to be like that. \\nN: Have you heard of um, I've co\\nmpletely forgotten her name now. \\nI: What's she in? \\n\\nN: She's a singer, I don't know her name. \\n\\nI: What does she look like? \\n\\nN: She's got like; she had brown now she's got blonde hair. \\nI: Kelly Clarkson? \\nN: That's it; I like her music a lot. \\n\\nI: What is it about Kelly Clarkson that you like and identify with? \\n\\nN: 'Cause on her videos when sings it's not \\nlike she just stands there, it's like she \\nexpresse s how she's feeling in the words th\\nat she says, she actually expresses herself \\nin the video she's not like just standing there singing it. \\nI: Is there anything else about her, not just her music but the type of person that you \\nthink she is// \\nN: //I think she's quite happy because I wa\\ntched an interview and she seemed quite \\nhappy and bubbly but I don't know if it's just for show, but she did seem happy and \\nwhat not so I think she's being true, so that's good. \\nI: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? \\n\\nN: I'm English. \\n\\nI: If you had the choice between Eng\\nlish or British, what would you say? \\nN: English, yeah. \\n\\nI: Do you think there's a difference though between English and British? \\nN: Yeah I think so. \\nI: What do you think the difference is? \\n\\nN: Is it just, aren't th ey like, 'cause British \\nis the whole country, no it's not, am I wrong? \\nI: What do you think? There's no right or wrong answer. \\n\\nN: No I don't know. \\nI: Are you going to say that you think British is the whole country including Scotland, \\nWales and No rthern Ireland, whereas England is just England// \\nN: //yeah// \\n\\nI: //so with England you are being more specific// \\n\\nN: //yeah// \\n\\nI: //about what country you come from// \\nN: //yeah. \\nI: OK that's brilliant.\",\n          \"I: Wow, you've got a lot on your collage. Where would you like to start with this? \\n\\nP: How other people think they see me as. \\n\\nI: OK, let's start this side [how I think \\nother people see me]. Now you've got quite a \\nfew images here of different women. What\\n does this head bit cut out on top of the \\nother body mean? \\nP: Some people just think I'm moody and I've got attitude. \\n\\nI: So some people think you're moody and that you've got attitude. \\n\\nP: Yeah. \\nI: What do all of these different faces mean? \\nP: That one says I'm confident [image of a girl in a yellow top]. \\n\\nI: Is that how you think other people see you, as confident? \\n\\nP: Yeah. Also friendly and funny \\n[various images of women's faces]. \\nI: What about this one [image of a black girl]? \\n\\nP: Pretty. \\nI: And what about that one [image of a girl looking up]? \\nP: I don't know, I just stuck it there. \\n\\nI: OK, you've also got \\u201aboring' [word]. \\n\\nP: Yeah, some people think I am boring. \\n\\nI: And what does this represent [image\\n of a champagne bottle in a bucket]? \\nP: That I'm lively. \\nI: That you're lively? \\n\\nP: Yeah. \\n\\nI: Is \\u201atalk too much' [words] this side to? \\n\\nP: Yeah. \\n\\nI: Now you've got pictures of somebody funny and confident, but then also moody, \\nattitude and boring. Do you think ot\\nher people see you as all those things? \\nP: Yeah, that's what I think. \\n\\nI: OK let's go onto this side [how I see myself]. What do these images mean? Let's \\nstart with the girl in the jeans. \\nP: Independent. \\nI: Independent. \\nP: Yeah. \\n\\nI: You've also though got the word \\u201abitch' with an arrow going to the independent. \\n\\nP: (laughter) No it's not supposed to go to there. \\n\\nI: So that wasn't deliberate? \\n\\nP: Yeah. \\nI: Do you think that this [independent] \\nis a positive quality or sometimes people think \\nit's negative? \\nP: What independent? \\n\\nI: Yes. \\n\\nP: Positive. \\nI: And what about these images [images of fashion items]? \\nP: I just like going out and shopping and thing and buy ing clothes for me. \\n\\nI: So you like your fashion and accessories? \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n431\\nP: Yeah. \\nI: And you've also got the words \\u201anice' and \\u201astar' and you've got \\u201agoing-out' there. \\nNow on this side [how I see my self], looking \\nat it, it seems very positive but on this \\nside [how I think other people see me] yo u've got \\u201aquiet', \\u201aboring', \\u201amoody', \\n\\u201aattitude'. Do you think that other people r\\neally know who you are, what type of \\nperson you are? \\nP: Most of them don't. \\n\\nI: Why do you think that that might be? \\n\\nP: Because I' m different around them. \\nI: In what way? \\nP: Quiet, bitchy. \\n\\nI: What was that? Bitchy// \\n\\nP: //to Kelly [pupil]. Sometimes I'm evil to people \\n\\nI: OK. If you could have used more images on your collage are there any pictures you \\nwould have liked to have been able put on? \\nP: No. \\n\\nI: So you think this summaries, this sums up \\nwhat were you were trying to express quite \\nwell. \\nP: Yeah. \\nI: That's great. So finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? \\nP: I don't know. \\n\\nI: Last week you wrote// \\n\\nP: //I was black. \\n\\nI: Would you ever describe your ethnicity as British? \\n\\nP: No. \\nI: Why not? \\nP: I don't know. \\n\\nI: Were you born in this country? \\n\\nP: Yeah. \\n\\nI: So you always describe yourself as black? \\nP: Yeah. \\nI: And you would never describe yourself as British? \\n\\nP: I would, but I'm confused. Yeah I would. \\n\\nI: OK, we'll leave it there, thank yo u.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"len\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4583,\n        \"min\": 1358,\n        \"max\": 27881,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 65,\n        \"samples\": [\n          14792,\n          3348\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 18,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 65,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 65,\n        \"samples\": [\n          54,\n          61\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sample\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 18.800159056315312,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 65.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 63,\n        \"samples\": [\n          64.0,\n          60.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 62,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ethnic identity, musical preferences, cultural heritage, family and upbringing, personal interests and hobbies, media representation, religious identity, social roles and relationships\",\n          \"sports interest, self-perception vs. others' perception, celebrity admiration, musical preferences\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":49}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# one hot encode the tags\n","one_hot = df_merged['labels'].str.get_dummies(sep=', ')\n","final_df = pd.concat([df_merged, one_hot], axis=1)\n","final_df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":742},"id":"wlqcogG8wMaa","outputId":"bdb1250c-8cd5-4955-891f-6228767842a9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       name  age                                            content   len  id  \\\n","0  Michelle   13  I: Let's begin with ‚how I see myself'.
