connect with customers. At its core, digital marketing aims to reach a targeted audience through various online and electronic means, including social media, email, search engines, and websites. Unlike traditional marketing methods, digital marketing offers unparalleled opportunities for businesses to engage with their audience in real-time, enabling personalized communication and immediate feedback. This real-time interaction not only enhances customer experience but also allows businesses to gather valuable data on consumer behaviors, preferences, and trends, facilitating more effective marketing strategies and campaigns.\n","The rise of digital marketing can be attributed to the increasing reliance on the internet and digital devices by consumers. As more people spend time online, businesses have shifted their marketing efforts to where their audiences are.
